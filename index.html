    <h1>Goals for 2024</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <ol>
        <h2 class="first-text">
            <li>
             Finish Udemy's Web Development Bootcamp
            </li>
        </h2>
            <p>
            As of April 7th, 2024 I have finished Immediate CSS (Section 7). 
            Before I start Advanced CSS (Section 8) I wanted to give myself a project to do to try to combine all that I learned so far. 
            Throughout the course there's exercises and projects, but I don't feel like I've really grasped the concepts. 
            I feel like while I'm learning them I understand the individual components, but I struggle when it comes to putting everything together. 
            This is not meant to be aesthetically pleasing. Just something that helps me visualize concepts and have a better understanding of what is happening.
            </p>

        <h2 class="second-text">
            <li>
            Learn to sail
            </li>
        </h2>
            <p class="para-text">
            I'm fascinated by sailing and love being around water. 
            It's something fun to try. 
            </p>
            
        <h2 class="third-text">

            <p draggable="true">
            Traveling internationally will have to wait, but I want to go on road trips and try new restuarants.
